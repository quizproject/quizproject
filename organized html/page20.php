	<p> 
		Now you are going to read a text in English. It is not written by a native speaker, 
		so there are some mistakes in it. 12 words are deleted from the text and presented 
		in [participant's native language] in the box above. Your task is to fill each gap 
		by dragging one of the 12 words to it. 
		If you realise you have made a mistake, just drag another word to the gap.
