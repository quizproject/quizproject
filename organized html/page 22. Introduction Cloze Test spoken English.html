<h1>Introduction cloze test spoken English.</h1>

	<p> 
		In this part you will listen to a text in English. It is spoken by a non-native speaker, 
		so there are some mistakes and a bit of foreign accent. One word in each fragment has been deleted 
		and you will hear a noise instead of the deleted word. After you hear each fragment twice, you will have 10 
		seconds to choose the word that belongs into the gap by clicking one word from the list of 12 words that are
		presented on the screen in Dutch.
